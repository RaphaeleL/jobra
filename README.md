It's just a local only Git clone in Java. Since i have already written it in Rust([RaphaeleL/cobra](https://github.com/RaphaeleL/cobra)), it's more like a rewrite in java, but in JAVA. 

Thereby it has the same features as cobra, but in Java. It has a few Commands, works with a Ref Storage and Tree Storage, and has a simple Object Storage.
